# TO-DO LIST
This is a simple text-based To-Do List application built using Python. It runs in the terminal and allows users to manage their daily tasks through a menu-based interface. The app supports adding new tasks, viewing the current task list, and removing tasks.  It was built as part of my beginner full stack journey to strengthen my logic, structure, and Python fundamentals.
